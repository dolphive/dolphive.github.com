Being a heavy Twitter user, I don't know how many times I refresh my timeline in a single day. Since I have a sun-never-sets timeline (by following people across almost all time zones), every time I do it, there are always new tweets. One thing I find fascinating about social network is that anyone can decide and tailor what you would like to see or be involved, I count on Twitter for breaking news (well, usually it doesn't mean that breaking), interesting stories, fresh ideas, new technologies, and updates from the service / apps I use, I talk a lot to friends there, and sometimes interfere conversations that catch me. I love Twitter.

The dark side of having a busy timeline is that you will always be risking missing stuff that you intended to be informed, well you can simply remove or (temporarily) mute some followings, but as a matter of face, Twitter has been aware of this issue and offers a handful tools to help release the pressure of intensive tweet feeds.

Like in Google, you can use a bunch of filters in Twitter to modify the tweets you would like to see. For instance, type **to:justinbiber since 2013-12-15 lang:en** in Twitter search box will fetch you all tweets written in English sent to Justin Biber since Dec. 15th, 2013. By using certain operators (and combinations) you can specify the results based on user, language, location, time, distance, hashtag, and more.


* **OSX Mavericks** -> containing both "OSX" and "Mavericks"
* **"OSX Mavericks"** -> containing the exact phrase "OSX Mavericks"
* **OSX OR Mavericks** -> containing either OSX or Mavericks (or both)

#### Save your searches
The search box on the top right corner of twitter.com is a power house and you can type any search term (with operators of course) directly in there and hit ENTER. Because the most recent 4 searches are saved, it is strongly recommended that you save the searches you would like to be updated. To access the saved search is only a hit away in the search box.

#### If you have Tweetbot...
My friend once asked if there is any tool which can showcase tweet results of multiple keyword subscriptions, the first thing that came to my mind is to make use of the advanced search. Truth be told, Tweetbot is the app for my Twitter usage on both Mac and iOS, and it has been famous in feature-rich since the very beginning, advanced search included! On Mac, you can search with operators from the Search tab, and open the results as a new column, in this way, you are supposed to be subscribed to the tailored tweets feed you want.
