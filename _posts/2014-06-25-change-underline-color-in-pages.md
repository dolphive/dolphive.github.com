Yesterday when preparing my resume in Apple Pages, I was stuck in one annoying issue:

> I CANNOT CHANGE THE COLOR OF THE UNDERLINE...

Rather than walk you through how I got in this trouble, I prefer to mark the goal instantly here. The workaround is simple, I'm sure you will be suddenly enlightened.

1. Select the underlined texts in Pages;
2. Hit âŒ˜ + T, the Fonts window pops up;
3. Click the Underline button, select Color in drop-down;
4. Pick the color you want.

Thats all. BOOM!
