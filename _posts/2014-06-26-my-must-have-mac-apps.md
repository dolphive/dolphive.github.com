Since the first day I got my Mac, I have been trying to turn it into a productivity monster. Now 4 months later, after getting back and forth in a variety of apps and consulting with some early Mac users and friends like [@hzlzh](http://twitter.com/hzlzh) and [@iBeetle](http://twitter.com/ibeetle), I think it's time to pull my must-have apps off the LaunchPad and list them here.

[Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) - FREE

I used Chrome a lot and I should admit that Apple feeds the Safari users on a dramatically solid update in Mountain Lion, Safari 6 now looks and feels much more superior than any other browsers out there and of course, integrates better with the system. Chrome will still be kept in my loop but I don't know when I will fire it again. :)

[iWork](http://www.apple.com/creativity-apps/mac/) - FREE for new Macs

Some say Office for Mac is a revenge for iTunes for Windows. There are a bunch of arguments about Office vs. iWork on Mac, which basically conclude that it depends on the users' working environment, say what do people you need to exchange these files most use. It's fair enough but believe me, Office for Mac is completely and woefully different for its Windows counterpart, its feature shortage and unresponsiveness are a pain in the ass. iWork, on the contrary, works smoothly in most scenarios.

[OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) - $79.99

Nothing much to say, simply the best GTD app ever. People may complain about its pain user interface but this seems to end soon.

[1Password](http://agilebits.com/onepassword) - $49.99

Your one-stop vault to store logins, accounts, credit card details, etc. LastPass is not a bad alternative but I definitely heart 1Password's UI especially when it comes to browser extensions.

[Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical) - $19.99

Fantastical sets the incarnation of what a calendar app should be: minimal UI, natural language support, and great integration with Google/Apple Calendar. You can only access it by clicking on the menubar icon, which is definitely a breeze to your real estate.

[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) - Â£17

Starting as an app launcher, Alfred has grown exponentially these days and somehow become a workflow changer to many users. Definitely a superior replacement for Spotlight, you can start with its free version, and Powerpack License, should be your next step.

[Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac/) - $19.99

It's really disappointing that Twitter limited the number of tokens 3rd-party apps can use, but merely considering the quality itself, Tweetbot is worth every penny you spend on it.

[MPlayerX](http://mplayerx.org/) - FREE

While QuickTime Player is used mainly by me to record and export screen, MPlayerX is my primary video player. It supports almost all video formats I have ever encountered and works great with subtitles.

[Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com/) - $15

Say you have a lot apps running in the background and they all want to show off their sense of being in your menubar, what you can do to maintain a clean and organized up-right? Bartender, the newly-released app last year, is dedicated to handle this scenario, and it works perfect.

[iStat Menus](http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) - $16

I like to keep an eye on the status of my CPU, RAM, Network, etc. iStat Menus provides a full range of the information and allows users to decide what they would like to track.

[Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php) - $28

Hazel helps keep your Mac clean and organized quietly and hell ya this means a lot! By creating rules and running them in the background, Hazel puts your files where you want them to be, in the way (name, label color, etc) you want, Hazel can also trigger AppleScript and scripts in the language of choice, making it a useful add-on to your workflows.

[Reflector](http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/) - $12.99

I bought Reflector in order to play iPhone games on my Mac haha. Later I noticed that I can actually create animated GIFs of iOS apps with Reflector and GIFBrewery:

1. Mirror your iOS device's screen to a Mac;
2. Use QuickTime to record the portion streaming iOS screen in real time and save;
3. Run GIFBrewery and refine the frames or create a GIF off the newly-recorded QuickTime video.

[Pastebot Sync](http://tapbots.com/software/pastebot/#sync) - $4.99

Pastebot proves the easiest way of copying/pasting between Mac and iOS devices. I actually emailed myself for this purpose before Pastebot. :(

[PopClip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) - $4.99

With PopClip, you can access context-specific actions instantly. PopClip is clever enough to detect what's selected and push exactly right action candidates including copy/paste, search, open in browser, email, etc. PopClip even offers corrections when a misspelled word is selected. There are a lot of cool extensions available on the official site which are supposed to simplify your workflow.

There are of course other apps I use on a daily basis, for example I am required to be on [Skype](http://www.skype.com) every weekday, and I chat with friends using [QQ](http://im.qq.com/macqq/). Besides, I feel not eligible to recommend apps like [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), [Coda 2](https://panic.com/coda/), [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit), [Adobe Creative Suite](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html), etc here, although I do use them, I am just scratching the surface.

I am going to update this entry regularly, be sure to check back and see if there is anything new.
